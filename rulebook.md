# CrossFit Customizable Card Game: Rulebook

### “Wait, what?” — An Introduction

### “Bacon and sweat” — The Setup

The basic setup for CFCCG looks like this: [TODO insert image of setup]

It consists of the following areas:

* The Arena
* The Catacombs
* The Unknowable

#### The Arena

The Arena consists of two rows of Workout cards, placed face-down. How many cards there are in a row is up to the players. We suggest an Rx of five cards, but again, it's up to you!

Each player sets up the Workouts for his opponent. The players decide beforehand if they want the Workouts to be put in a random order (“any-asshole-workout”) or in an order deliberately constructed by their opponent for maximum discomfort (“you-asshole-workout”).

The Workouts are completed from left to right, so at the beginning of her first turn, player 1 flips her leftmost Workout card.

#### The Catacombs

The Catacombs consists of two stacks of Athlete cards, one for each player. Before the match the players need to agree whether they want their stacks shuffled, bringing their Athletes into play in random order, or whether their stacks can be in a pre-planned order.

How many Athletes are in the stacks is up to the players, Rx is 12.

#### The Unknowable

Each player has a stack of Modifier cards. These cards are shuffled at least once before the first turn begins.

### “On-ramp” — The Cards

#### Workouts

#### Athletes

An Athlete card displays the following attributes:

* strength
* endurance
* flexibility

#### Modifiers
